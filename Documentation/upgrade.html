	<h2 id="v42">Upgrading to 4.2</h2>
	<div class="inner">
		<p>
			Version 4.2 is another major update that includes many new features and improvements. There is a new clean theme called "CleanPixel" that can be activated at any time via the admin panel. There is also a new feature that allows you to offer all premium features for free. Google connect has been updated to use the latest API. A couple of bugs were fixed and performance was improved. Finally Google Analytics was removed to many issues. It will remain this way until a better method is found. Simply follow the instructions below to update to the latest version. If you want to upload on a file-by-file basis (not recommended), I suggest you don't update it because many files were updated/modified.
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Backup your files and your database</li>
				<li>Delete all files from your server</li>
				<li>Upload new files to your server</li>
				<li>Open the file includes/config_sample.php and fill the database info, security key (use the old one), timezone and public token (a random hash because it is publicly&nbsp;visible then rename that to config.php</li>
				<li>Run the file updater.php</li>
				<li>Once the update is completed, you should be able to use the new features</li>

	<div class="inner">
		<p>Some bugs were fixed in version 4.1 and some small additions were made. The easiest and safest way to upgrade from 4.0 is to overwrite everything except config.php, updater.php and installer.php however if you have made some changes you may upload only following files:

		<p>There are many new additions in version 4.0 both in the database and core features for this reason it is highly recommended to make a clean installation. Please note that <strong>you are not required to update if you are perfectly happy with current version</strong>. You can still upgrade you current version however some features like the recent activities will not work properly because the database has been optimized.The major change has been in the stats table. This was done to simplify the retrieval of data thus all old clicks will not be updated and will miss some information.</p>

		<div class="inner">
			In this version, a small issue was fixed to prevent users or bots from shortening URLs of the site where the shortener is installed. Moreover, there was also an addition to prevent users from abusing clicks. Now each time a user clicks on a link, no matter how any times the browser is refreshed, the number of clicks will not be updated for 5 mins from the first click. This number can be easily changed according to your preference: Open Core.php and find <code>define('Click_Interval','5');</code> and replace "5" by the number of <strong>minutes</strong> to wait before taking into account the click from the SAME USER. In Short.class.php the function <code>isBot</code> was added at the end and the function <code>update</code> was updated with two new piece of code.

			A small bug preventing users to delete their URLs was fixed in User.class.php. This is the only file affected. You can either replace this file or correct the error your self.
			<p>To correct it yourself, open User.class.php and go line 317 where you will see the following code:</p>			
			<pre>$query="DELETE FROM {$this->config["prefix"]}url WHERE id=:id AND uid=:uid";</pre>
			Just replace <b>uid=</b> by userid= and this will fix the issue.

			You also have to open core.php and update the version to 1.8.1 or you can just replace it by the new one.
